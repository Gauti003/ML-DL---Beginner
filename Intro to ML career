# ML/DL---Beginner
This is my intro into the journey of ML/DS career

Hello World!
    Before starting my journey into Machine/Deep Learning career I would like to give a breif introduction about myself.
    I have a bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering, Masters in Aeronautical Enginnering
    Work Experience : 1. Researach Assisant @ National Aerospace Laboratoires 
                         Worked on Fixed Wing UAV onground Target Tracking Systems and Flight Controls
                      2. Senior Software Enginner @ KPIT Tehcnologies
                         Worked on Advanced Driver Assistant Systems 
                      3. VKN Earth Movers 
                         Business Analyst
    Started preparing for Civil Services simulataneously. 
    
   Now I am back to my Beginner Journey of Starting my Career.* 
         I started to ponder over my career direction and started revisiting my experiences and domain, knowledge gained 
         through civil services preparation and I narrowed my interest towards Sustainability, Economics, Climate Change , Business and nextgen Tech.
         After a through research of 3 months in each field and reading many articles and career growth prospects, I found that there was no further
         narrowing of career choice as the world is evolving very rapidly and multidimensionally cutting across many diffrent subjects, it is better 
         to choose a career where I evolve through constant learning and unlearning. Yeah! finally this introspection of me said - 'Survaival of the fittest'
         
         Again, I started researching for another 2 months for finding answers to the questions like  where and how to start my career , spending sleepless nights, 
         tensed mornings, difficulty to face people because of my current joblessness and all other negative vibes that follows when things dont go right , 
         peer presure, financial dependencies, career break and other unplanned events that happen due to wrong decisons.
         
         After extensive research, I decided to restart my career with nextgen technologies like DS/ML/DL/Ai , but why ? whats my motivation and confidence?
                    Yes, I did have a lot of selfdoubts about choosing a new field , difficulties in unlearning and relearning, employability, job Prospects, 
                    experience, paycheck, and many more.
                    
         I started answering to these selfdoubts as follows:
                  1. Confidence & Courage  : To travel a unknown path we need courage and confidence , yes I have it - look at my previous travel path, I did it.
                                             Took risks , gained Knowledge, this journey was an experience initself about my strength and weakness. I can learn 
                                             and I will learn, to prevail in this ever evolving world. 
                                             
                  2. Yes, I can Learn - what next?: Why did I chose ML/DL/Ai to learn and make a career out of it ?
                                            For the next 2 or 3 decades this tech is gona evolve rapidly and pretty much everything we depend on today has this                                                     technology intertwined. Finances, food, shopping, nameit this tech is inevitable. Since i belive  this has a future 
                                            to make a career and to some extent even a minimalst tech user will make use of Ai/ML/DL exampe atleast in UPI 
                                            payments, shopping, social media etc. 
                                            
                  3. Ok, all good! i have chosen my career path, and also have a strong reason to believe its the right decision made and also ready to face 
                     any adversaries that comes in this path. Everything has its own advantages and disadvatages , have to deal with it.

   ** Machine learning, at its core, is the discipline of teaching machines to detect patterns and perform tasks by presenting them training data**
      the more training data, the better machines perform in various tasks such as medical analysis, financial analysis, bio technology, research,
      games, fraud detectionâ€”with hundreds of new applications getting published every day in diverse research disciplines such as biology, mathematics, 
      finance, engineering, history, and law theory. More training data leads to a higher degree of automation which, in turn, generates better results 
      much quicker and cheaper than ever before.                                                                              
          
      Data scientists use computers to gain insights from massive amounts of data. These insights have a profound influence on the products we see,
      the medicines we take, the education we enjoy, the movies we watch, the routes we drive, the holidays we choose, and the foods we produce and 
      consume.
